## Background

Born and raised in the California Bay Area I have always been awed by the new technological advancments and inventions being developed. Hearing about the world changing products being built close to home gave me a deep passion for innovation and the entreprenurial life. This influenced me to dive deep into new markets, whether that included joining AI clubs, robotics classes, or lectures to her and understand what was out their and wanted is still needed. All in all my passion and drive to enter Product Mangement has come from my character of liking to create and improve. Whether it is a room, a toy, or a system my mind thrives on seeing the possible.
