2. Profile auto-created (trigger)
3. Free subscription auto-assigned (trigger)
4. User can create 5 listings, send 10 requests
```

**Hitting Limits:**
```
1. User tries 6th listing → Blocked
2. "Upgrade to Premium" prompt shown
3. User clicks upgrade → Opens Stripe checkout
4. User completes payment
5. Webhook updates database → Premium activated
6. User returns to app → Unlimited access
```

**Monthly Reset:**
```
1. New month starts
2. Usage counters reset to 0
3. Free users get fresh limits

```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Total Premium Users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_subscriptions
WHERE status = 'active'
AND plan_id = (SELECT id FROM subscription_plans WHERE slug = 'premium');

-- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
SELECT COUNT(*) * 9.99 AS mrr
FROM user_subscriptions us
JOIN subscription_plans sp ON us.plan_id = sp.id
WHERE us.status = 'active' AND sp.slug = 'premium';

-- Conversion Rate
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_subscriptions WHERE plan_id = (SELECT id FROM subscription_plans WHERE slug = 'premium'))::float /
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles)::float * 100 AS conversion_rate_percent;

-- Users Close to Limits
SELECT u.user_id, p.username, u.listings_created, u.requests_sent
FROM usage_tracking u
JOIN profiles p ON u.user_id = p.id
JOIN user_subscriptions s ON u.user_id = s.user_id
WHERE s.plan_id = (SELECT id FROM subscription_plans WHERE slug = 'free')
AND (u.listings_created >= 4 OR u.requests_sent >= 8);
```

## 💰 Revenue Projections

### Assumptions
- 1,000 active users
- 5% conversion rate to Premium
- $9.99/month per premium user

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
```
1,000 users × 5% = 50 premium users
50 × $9.99 = $499.50/month
```

### Annual Revenue
```
$499.50 × 12 = $5,994/year
```

### At Scale (10,000 users)
```
10,000 × 5% = 500 premium users
500 × $9.99 = $4,995/month
$4,995 × 12 = $59,940/year
```
