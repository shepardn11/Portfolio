## 🎯 How Priority Placement Works

### Feed Sorting Algorithm

**Before (Everyone Equal):**
```
Listings sorted by: created_at DESC
```

**After (Premium First):**
```
Listings sorted by:
1. is_premium DESC  ← Premium listings first
2. created_at DESC  ← Then by newest
```

### Visual Example

**Feed Display:**
```
[⭐ Premium] John's coffee meetup - 2 min ago
[⭐ Premium] Sarah's hiking trip - 5 min ago
[⭐ Premium] Mike's game night - 10 min ago
─────────────────────────────────────────────
[Free] Alex's dinner plans - 1 min ago
[Free] Emma's concert - 3 min ago
[Free] Chris's workout - 7 min ago
```

**Key Insight:**
- Premium listing posted 10 min ago appears ABOVE free listing posted 1 min ago
- Premium users get 3-5x more visibility
- More views = More requests = Better connections

## 🎨 UI/UX Best Practices

### Where to Show Premium Badge
1. **On Listings:**
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────┐
   │ [⭐ PREMIUM]       │
   │ Coffee at 3pm?     │
   │ @john_doe          │
   └─────────────────────┘
   ```

2. **On User Profiles:**
   ```
   John Doe [⭐ PREMIUM]
   @john_doe
   ```

3. **In Settings:**
   ```
   Subscription: Premium ⭐
   ```

### Where to Promote Upgrades
1. **After creating 3+ listings**
   ```
   "You're active! Get 5x more views with Premium"
   ```

2. **Low engagement listings**
   ```
   "Only 2 views? Premium listings get seen first"
   ```

3. **Profile settings**
   ```
   Subtle banner: "Stand out with Premium"
   ```

### DON'T Do This
❌ Block features
❌ Intrusive popups

❌ Fake urgency ("Only today!")

### DO This

## 💰 Revenue Projections (Updated)

### Conservative Estimates
```
Assumptions:
- 1,000 active users
- 2% conversion rate (lowered price = easier conversion)
- $4.99/month per premium user

MRR: 1,000 × 2% × $4.99 = $99.80/month
ARR: $99.80 × 12 = $1,197.60/year
```

### Realistic Growth
```
Month 1: 100 users × 2% = 2 premium → $10/mo
Month 3: 500 users × 2% = 10 premium → $50/mo
Month 6: 2,000 users × 2.5% = 50 premium → $250/mo
Month 12: 10,000 users × 3% = 300 premium → $1,500/mo

Year 1 Revenue: ~$5,000
Year 2 Revenue: ~$25,000
Year 3 Revenue: ~$60,000
```

### Why Conversion Will Be Higher
1. **Lower price** ($4.99 vs $9.99) = easier decision
2. **No feature blocking** = happier users
3. **Clear value** = users see benefit
4. **Power users naturally upgrade** = self-selecting

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Healthy KPIs
- **Conversion Rate:** 2-4% (free → premium)
- **Churn Rate:** <3% monthly
- **Engagement Lift:** Premium users post 3x more
- **View Increase:** Premium listings get 5-10x views

### Red Flags to Watch
- ⚠️ Conversion <1% → Price might be too high
- ⚠️ Churn >5% → Not enough value
- ⚠️ Premium engagement lower → Not working
- ⚠️ Feed dominated by premium → Hurts free users
